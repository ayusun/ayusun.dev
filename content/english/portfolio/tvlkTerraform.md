Being part of Traveloka, I contributed to various terraform modules that was contributed back to the community. The contribution was mostly in the form of new features/fixes. The need to fix these modules generally originates from my need to use the module and realising that they need some improvements

#### Project Details

Most of my fixes in these projects are mostly around tightining security.
