Back in college, I used LAMP for my development. While using phpMyAdmin, I got curious and started looking into source code itself and thus began my first contribution to OpenSource World. Learned about git and github. It was a good opportunity to learn about the project collaboration. My initial few pull request got tuned down because of quality or duplicated efforts or incorrect implementation. Ended up making <b>5 improvements</b> to the project.


#### Project Details

Worked on multiple bugs and feature request in the year of 2013.
